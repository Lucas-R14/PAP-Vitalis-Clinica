# PAP-Vitalis-Clinica

This project is part of my **"Projeto de AptidÃ£o Profissional" (PAP)**, a final-year project required for the completion of my course. The **PAP** is a practical assessment that demonstrates the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the academic journey, showcasing the ability to develop a complete and functional solution.
